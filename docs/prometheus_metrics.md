# Prometheus Metrics Description
## Service Metrics
Service metrics are generated from the server-side events, which are used to show the quality of service. 
| **Metric Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| kindling_entity_request_total | Counter | Total number of requests |
| kindling_entity_request_duration_nanoseconds_total | Counter | Total duration of requests |
| kindling_entity_request_send_bytes_total | Counter | Total size of payload sent |
| kindling_entity_request_receive_bytes_total | Counter | Total size of payload received |
| kindling_entity_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_count  | Histogram | Count of average duration of requests |
| kindling_entity_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_sum | Histogram | Sum of average duration of requests |
| kindling_entity_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_bucket | Histogram | Histogram buckets of average duration of requests |

| **Label Name** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| node | worker-1 | Node name represented in Kubernetes cluster |
| namespace | default | Namespace of the Pod |
| workload_kind | daemonset | K8sResourceType |
| workload_name | api-ds | K8sResourceName |
| service | api | One of the services that target this pod |
| pod | api-ds-xxxx | The name of the pod |
| container | api-container | The name of the container |
| container_id | 1a2b3c4d5e6f | The shorten container id which contains 12 characters |
| ip | 10.1.11.23 | The IP address of the entity |
| port | 80 | The listening port of the entity |
| protocol | http | The application layer protocol the requests use |
| request_content | /test/api | The request content of the requests |
| response_content | 200 | The response content of the requests |
| is_slow | false | (Only applicable to `kindling_entity_request_total`)<br>Whether the requests are considered as slow |

**The labels "request_content" and "response_content" hold different values when "protocol" is different.**

- When protocol is http:
  
| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| request_content | /test/api | Endpoint of HTTP request. URL has been truncated to avoid high-cardinality. |
| response_content | 200 | 'Status Code' of HTTP response. |

- When protocol is dns:
  
| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| request_content | www.google.com | Domain to be queried |
| response_content | 0 | "rcode" of DNS response. Including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 |

- When protocol is mysql:
  
| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| request_content | select employee | SQL of MySQL. SQL has been truncated to avoid high-cardinality. The format is ['operation' 'space' 'table']. |
| response_content |  | Empty temporarily. |

- When protocol is kafka:
  
| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| request_content | user-msg-topic | Topic of Kafka request. |
| response_content |  | Empty temporarily. |

- For other cases, the `request_content` and `response_content` are both empty.

## Topology Metrics

Topology metrics are typically generated from the client-side events, which are used to show the service dependencies map, so the metrics are called `topology`. Some timeseries may be generated from the server-side events, which contain a non-empty label `dst_container_id`. These timeseries are generated only when the source IP is not the Pod's IP inside the Kubernetes cluster, which are useful when there is no agent installed on the client-side. 

| **Metric Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| kindling_topology_request_total | Counter | Total number of requests |
| kindling_topology_request_duration_nanoseconds_total | Counter |  Total duration of requests |
| kindling_topology_request_request_bytes_total | Counter | Total size of payload sent |
| kindling_topology_request_response_bytes_total | Counter | Total size of payload received |
| kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_count | Histogram | Count of average duration of requests |â€‹
| kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_sum | Histogram | Sum of average duration of requests  |
| kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_bucket | Histogram | Histogram buckets of average duration of requests |

## Trace As Metric
We made some rules for considering whether a request is abnormal. For the abnormal request, the detail request information is considered as useful for debugging or profiling. We name this kind of data `trace`. It is not a good practice to store such data in Prometheus as some labels are high-cardinality, so we picked up some labels from the original ones to generate a new kind of metric, which is called `Trace As Metric`. The following table shows what labels this metric contains.  

| **Metric Name** | **Type** | **Description** |

## PromQL Example
Here are some examples of how to use these metrics in Prometheus, which can help you understand them faster.

| **Describe** | **PromQL** |
| --- | --- |
| Request counts | `sum(increase(kindling_entity_request_total{namespace="$namespace",workload_name="$workload"}[5m])) by(namespace, workload_name)` |

| Error ratio of HTTP requests | `sum (increase(kindling_entity_request_total{namespace="$namespace",workload_name="$workload",protocol="http",response_content=~"4..\|5.."}[5m])) / sum (increase(kindling_entity_request_total{namespace="$namespace",workload_name="$workload",protocol="http"}[5m])) * 100` |
